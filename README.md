Basic Python Projects

This repository contains Python related projects as part of the Prosper I.T. Consulting's Software Developer Internship.

Vegas Application (AppBuilder9000 -> VegasApp):

This is a sample Web Application utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Django-related functions. This "VegasApp" application acts as a blog website where users can view and share activity recommendations for the city of Las Vegas. These activities are broken up into three sections, which include "Dining," "Attractions", and "Travel" areas. Users may view and subnmit their own activities under their respective tabs located in the navbar. Styling for these pages also include animations for the navbar, image headers, and contact button leading to a sign up form allowing users to stay updated on new recommendations.

Django Checkbook:

This folder contains a sample Python application named "Blue Bird Banking" which acts as an example of a checkbook bank system program. Users can create accounts by inputting their information along with their any initial deposits they'd like to submit. Once an account is created, they may use the dropdown menu to search for their account and view their recent transaction, as well as their current balance.

Check Files GUI (Graphical User Interface):

Using the "file_transfer.py" Python file, this program allows the user to transfer all .txt files from one chosen directory to another. All files that are moved will be saved in a database.
